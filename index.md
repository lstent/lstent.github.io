### About me

My name is Lucy Stent, I am 24 and about to start my second year of a Bsc in computer science at Falmouth University, the year before coming to Falmouth University I completed Cert.HE for IT including Robotics and Maths acheiving a distinction grade from the Open University.
At 19 I was awarded a BTEC (at PPM grade) in Land management from Falmouth marine school and worked for some time as a zookeeper before deciding to take the leap and follow my dream to becoming a game programmer.
I left main stream school at 14 as I have dyslexia and dyspraxia and falling behind in most classes compared to my peers, I was then educated by Oxford Open Learning and recieved a B in double science, C in English, C in Math and B in Psychology.
