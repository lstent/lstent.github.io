### About me

My name is Lucy Stent, I am 24 and about to start my second year of a Bsc in computer science at Falmouth University, the year before coming to Falmouth University I completed Cert.HE for IT including Robotics and Maths acheiving a distinction grade from the Open University.

At 19 I was awarded a BTEC (at PPM grade) in Land management from Falmouth marine school and worked for some time as a zookeeper before deciding to take the leap and follow my dream to becoming a game programmer.

I left main stream school at 14 as I have dyslexia and dyspraxia and falling behind in most classes compared to my peers, I was then educated by Oxford Open Learning and recieved a B in double science, C in English, C in Math and B in Psychology.

## **Games**

### Slime EVO

_(Built using python and pygame)_

Slime Evo is a platform game in which the player takes control of a glob of slime and traverses levels by manipulating the size of the slime.

Built by a team of 4 programmers, my contribution was to make the collision for the slime to stand on the platforms and gravity for the slime to fall onto said platforms.

### Street Cat Fighter and Controller

_(Built using C++, Unreal Engine and Arduino)_

Street cat fighter is a fighting game in which the player controls a new cat in the neighborhood which fights the other cats to gain territory and eventually takes over the whole town, the player cat is controlled by pressing buttons on a cat teddy e.g. the right arm is claw, the left arm is block, the mouth is bite and the tail is stun.

I built the game and controller over several months, here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWThEZve9o) to the controller in use.

### Standby

_(Built using Unreal engine)_

Standby is a first person sci-fi horror set in the future when homes are controlled by robot servents, the player is the inventer of a new robot butler which had gone rogue and now seeks to kill its master, the player has to interact with objects in the environment to distract the robot and also find keycard to unlock doors and eventually destroy the server in the basement to kill the robot.

This game was created by a team of writers, artists, animaters, designers and programmers. I programmed the AI for the Robot, which included the robot searching randomly for the player, chasing the player when they come into sight, movement speed depending on the situation, hearing the player depending on how fast the player moved and damage to the player when the robot entered the players collision capsule which takes a large chunk of health then slowly drains the rest if the player remains in the collision state.

I also programmed the torch attached to the phone and the axe which lighted up when the player was near which also had to be picked up for the player to destroy the server and win the game.

I created the controlls screen and the credits screen creating clickable links for them from the start screen and pause menu.
