## **Games**

### Slime EVO

_(Built using python and pygame)_

Slime Evo is a platform game in which the player takes control of a glob of slime and traverses levels by manipulating the size of the slime.

Built by a team of 4 programmers, my contribution was to make the collision for the slime to stand on the platforms and gravity for the slime to fall onto said platforms.

### Street Cat Fighter and Controller

_(Built using C++, Unreal Engine and Arduino)_

Street cat fighter is a fighting game in which the player controls a new cat in the neighbourhood which fights the other cats to gain territory and eventually takes over the whole town, the player cat is controlled by pressing buttons on a cat teddy e.g. the right arm is claw, the left arm is block, the mouth is bite and the tail is stun.

I built the game and controller over several months, here is a [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tlWThEZve9o) to the controller in use.

### Standby

_(Built using Unreal engine)_

Standby is a first person sci-fi horror set in the future when homes are controlled by robot servants, the player is the inventor of a new robot butler which had gone rogue and now seeks to kill its master, the player has to interact with objects in the environment to distract the robot and also find key card to unlock doors and eventually destroy the server in the basement to kill the robot.

This game was created by a team of writers, artists, animators, designers and programmers. I programmed the AI for the Robot, which included the robot searching randomly for the player, chasing the player when they come into sight, movement speed depending on the situation, hearing the player depending on how fast the player moved and damage to the player when the robot entered the players collision capsule which takes a large chunk of health then slowly drains the rest if the player remains in the collision state.

I also programmed the torch attached to the phone and the axe which lighted up when the player was near which also had to be picked up for the player to destroy the server and win the game.

I created the controls screen and the credits screen creating clickable links for them from the start screen and pause menu.

### High Tide

_(Built using Unreal engine)_

High Tide is a local couch co-op multiplayer (in the making) which the player controls a shark and has to eat more than the other players to win the game. Each shark has different abilities depending on what species the player chooses which can mean your shark is faster or has an ability to hoover in all the fish within a certain range and maybe even stun another player. Also depending on what type of fish you each you can gain or loose different number of points. There are different maps and game modes including a peaceful reef that you race against time to eat more than your friends or an underwater shipwreck that has dangerous enemies that you must avoid to succeed.

This game is being created by a team of audio, artists, animators, designers and programmers. I am the lead programmer in the team as I have a previous knowledge of programming in Unreal Engine. I work closely with the designers, artists and animators to say what is possible and what is not possible within the time frame and helping navigate them through the engine. I also help the other programmers understand what the tasks are for the current sprint and how we can create the mechanics within the game, I also pair program with them if they need help so I can talk it through with them and discuss how we can solve the problem.

I have so far created the UI, local multiplayer split-screen, collision, designed and created an interactive character choice (in which the player swims into the shark they want to become in the game). I created the AI fish to swim around the level in which they have sight and hearing tell them if a player is close and if that it true swim away, the sight and hearing also helps them follow other fish to make it appear as though the fish schooling. Most importantly finding and fixing any bugs.
