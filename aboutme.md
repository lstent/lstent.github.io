## **About me**
  
My name is Lucy Stent, I am 26 and in my third year of a Bsc in Computing for Games at Falmouth University, in September 2017
I was awarded for academic achievement at the Women in Games conference in London.

The year before coming to Falmouth University I completed Cert.HE for IT including Robotics and Maths achieving a distinction grade from   the Open University.

At 19 I was awarded a BTEC (at PPM grade) in Land management from Falmouth marine school and worked for some time as a zookeeper before   deciding to take the leap and follow my dream to becoming a game programmer.

I left main stream school at 14 as I have dyslexia and dyspraxia and falling behind in most classes compared to my peers, I was then       educated by Oxford Open Learning and received a B in double science, C in English, C in Math, B in Psychology and B in Geography.
