## What are the advantages and disadvantages to using behaviour trees in simple NPC programming for digital games?

One of the deciding factors on how well a game is rated is the behaviour of the NPC AI within the game, their movement and senses have to be realistic, e.g. if the NPC enemy is supposed to detect the player with sight, it would be wrong for the player to be detected through a wall. Therefore programming an NPC is one of the most important parts of producing a game and should be simplified as much as possible, unfortunately there are many different ways to programme an AI controlled character, of which behaviour trees is one of the most recent methods, this paper looks into the advantages and disadvantages of simple NPC programming using behaviour trees. The conclusion discusses whether the advantages of behaviour trees outweigh the disadvantages and the future of NPC AI programming.

## Undergraduate students lack the maturity skills in order to use Agile methodologies, such as Scrum efficiently

This paper discusses the implementation of Agile methodologies (focusing on Scrum) in non-professional teams, particularly within the classroom setting, when Scrum can quickly become biased. This could refer, for example to one group member who may be given the majority of the workload, or the more complex of the Scrum tasks, while another member is given an easier task to complete in the same time period. This is in comparison to Agile being used in a professional games industry, where there is a more mature view of the working relationship. After outlining these problems, this paper presents possible solutions in the form of practice collaboration tasks, teaching the correlation of daily stand up meetings, positivity and team productivity.

## The history of digital facial replication including methods used and problems that arose

Photorealism is a very important factor to take into account for creating characters for digital games, if the game has an emotional plot line the more realistic the facial expressions of the characters whether happy or sad, the more likely the player will become emotionally invested in the story, the game will feel more immersive. Rockstar Games LA Noire is a good example of using expressions within a digital game as the story involved judging an NPCs expression to decide if what they have said is true or false, is the character angry, happy or upset?

In this paper I looked into the history of digital face replication to find how the methods evolved, the problems the creators experienced. The conclusion summarises what was learnt in those years, the importance of what the authors did and looking at their papers what we can expect in the future.

## Digital Game Piracy: Criminals or Archivers?

This paper discusses digital game piracy of abandonware/ orphan works. First stating what the law on digital game piracy is and looking at the research on how damaging it is to game studios, how much of the worlds population takes part in it, some of the possible reasons why individuals pirate digital games.

The topic of pirating abandonware is then explored, giving a brief definition of both orphan works and abandonware, why digital game companies abandon titles, legal methods of archiving and the effect piracy has on archiving digital games.

The conclusion summarises all the information, weighing the benefits against the drawback of piracy to find if individuals deserve to be labelled as criminals.

## AR/VR Userbility

This paper focuses on the usability issues that other papers have found in AR and VR. AR/ VR are relatively new, also because of the price and room needed to use them they are not as popular as traditional gaming platforms (e.g. Xbox, PlayStation, PC), therefore studies on usability are important so those that own or try it enjoy the experience.
